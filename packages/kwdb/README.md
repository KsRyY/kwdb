[![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=kwdb)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=kwdb)

> A REST wrap for LevelDB, powered by koa

## Which version should I choose?

- If you want to hack kwdb or make a custom storage/service and you are familiar to `Express`, choose `kwdb@1`.
- If you also want to hack kwdb or make a custom storage/service, but you are familiar with `Koa`, choose `kwdb@2`.
- Otherwise, use the `latest` tag.

## Usage

To just simply use kwdb as a data storage service, install kwdb globally:

``` bash
npm i -g kwdb
```

and then start it from the kwdb cli:

``` bash
kwdb
```

For more usage, see [kwdb document](https://ksryy.github.io/kwdb)
